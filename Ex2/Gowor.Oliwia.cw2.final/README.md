# The scope of the final version of the application after exercise 2:

* full scope of the final version of the application from exercise 1,
* adding a collection that is safe with regard to object types to the model class,
* use of for-each loops
* use of one of the following:
  * enumerated type,
  * own generic type,
  * variable number of method parameters,
  * own annotation (other than in the demonstration examples),
  * lambda expression (with defined interface).
* use of data stream processing in collections,
* defining unit tests for all public methods included in the model (except constructors, accessors and mutators)
* tests should cover correct, incorrect and borderline situations for each tested unit,
* we do not test with limit values from the value range of simple types,
* parameterization of all tests,
* unit tests should be commented.
